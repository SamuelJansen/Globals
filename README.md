# Globals
This library allows global access to different python api classes and functions

# Simplest way to use it

- put all your git projects you wanna exchange classes between them in a single folder
```
C:\Users\my_user\path\path\path\all_my_git_projects
```
![Directory with all mai guit projects](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/67/ec/2c/67ec2c13bc7ee72a06eb737eac3dc8bb.png)


- on the directory you wanna launch the "main api" (the one that will consume other projects classes and funtions), 
you put the PathMannanger.py file following this path tree:
```
C:\Users\my_user\path\path\path\all_my_git_projects\my_launcher_api\api\src\domain\control\PathMannanger.py
```
![PathMannanger.py file](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/a3/3e/d1a33efcc8880eefadec49f503352429.png)

- put the following code right on top of the __main__ class of your api
```
from api.src.domain.control import PathMannanger
PathMannanger.PathMannanger(mode = 'WRONG_WAY_TO_MAKE_IT_WORKS',printStatus = True)
```
![Chess api main file](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/8f/f7/b08ff711e5a04ee88ec9eb65d6a04a28.png)

- Be happy. 

You don'd even need to specify the path of the classes you are importing.

Yes, its really that simple. ðŸŒˆâœ¨ðŸŽ‡

# Aboute the proper way to use this library
I'll be implementing more funcionalities in order to make it extendable and more compatible to python framewors in general.
